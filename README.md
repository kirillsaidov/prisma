## Goals
Most libraries forget about the user, leaving him wondering in dark and making libraries frustrating to install, use and package. Thus, installing Prisma should be simple, using it should feel intuitive and packaging the library self-explanatory, aided with sufficient documentation.

The above can be summarized into the following:
1. Easy to install;
2. Easy to use;
3. Easy to package.
