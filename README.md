    <h2>PRISMA<br>Tiny computer vision library aimed at ease of use and usability.</h2>    
</div>

## Goals
Most libraries forget about the user side of things, leaving him wondering in the dark and making it frustrating to install, use and package a library. Thus, installing Prisma should be simple, using it should feel intuitive and packaging the library self-explanatory, aided with sufficient documentation.

Moreover, the library should be lightweight, available for embedded usage and cross-platform, implementing only the necessary features mainly for CPU execution.  

The above can be summarized into the following:
1. Easy to install, use and package;
2. Lightweight, embeddable, cross-platform.
